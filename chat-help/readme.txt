Add WhatsApp click to chat with floating chat button, chat to order for WooCommerce, and chat forms to convert visitors into customers.

== Description ==

WhatsApp Chat plugin for WordPress makes it simple to add **WhatsApp chat support** to your WordPress site with a customizable floating chat bubble, WooCommerce buttons, shortcode buttons, Gutenberg block, and Elementor widget. Whether you’re running a **WooCommerce store**, a blog, or a service website, Chat Help lets visitors connect with you instantly via **WhatsApp** or **WhatsApp Business**—even join your **WhatsApp Group** directly.

Unlike traditional contact forms or delayed email responses, **WhatsApp click-to-chat buttons** give customers a familiar, fast, and trusted way to reach you. With **pre-filled messages**, **dynamic variables**, **agent lists**, **availability scheduling**, and **GDPR consent**, Chat Help ensures every conversation feels personal, professional, and convenient.

By offering multiple layouts (Simple Button, Single Agent, Single Form, Multi-Agent List/Grid, and Advanced Button), you can design the perfect **WhatsApp chat bubble** that matches your brand and support needs.

**Why Add WhatsApp Chat Support?**
- 2.78+ billion users rely on WhatsApp for messaging worldwide
- Customers prefer **instant messaging over email** for support and inquiries
- A visible **WhatsApp chat button** builds trust and increases conversions
- Businesses using **multi-agent WhatsApp chat** improve response time and satisfaction
- Smart features like **pre-filled messages** and **WooCommerce product variables** reduce friction and boost sales

With Chat Help, you’re not just adding a button—you’re creating a complete **WhatsApp customer support system** inside WordPress.
